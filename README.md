# Aptitude-Test-System

This is a project for my Programming Fundamentals course. I developed an aptitude test system. There are two portals, one for administrators and the other for students. Students will first enter their Student ID and Password into the system, after which the test will begin and a random question will display on the screen. When a student finishes a test, the system will automatically generate a total for that student and save the data in a file. An administrator can access all of a student's files and scores, as well as determine cut-off criteria for admitting students.
